Dealing with incorrect input

There are a few different ways in dealing with incorrect input. Here are a few: fixing it yourself in the code, throwing exceptions, and providing javadoc requirements.

1) Fixing it yourself

	Good for informal context, results that aren't terribly important to be correct, etc. 

	Example: you are making a video game script that takes current damage amount and multiplies it by a provided amount. People who use the mod won't see the requirements, and you don't want a server to crash if they use a wrong amount, so you'll just deal with it. Here, if someone provides input below 0, it's set back to above 0. Changing tihs amount isn't that big of a deal. 

2) Throwing exceptions

	Good for more formal content, when it's necessary to have a program crash instead of giving incorrect results. It's also good for when it would be too convoluted or difficult to fix it manually.

	Example

		public T dequeue(){		// removing an item of type T (whatever type the queue has) from a list called a queue
			if(isEmpty()){
				throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException("Queue.dequeue() exception: Cannot dequeue from empty queue");	
			}
			return shiftDown();
		}

3) Javadoc requirements

	Good for formal content, when you're making things that you won't be dealing with errors, things without user input, etc .
